# Chec e-receipt email Template with MJML 

This is a basic tutorial of creating your own custom e-receipt for your customers who have just made a purchase on your Chec e-Commerce website. We will be using MJML, an email templating framework to help with design and formatting. Check out MJML docs at https://mjml.io/documentation/. The best thing about MJML is the responsive templating. All attributes are automatically responsive, eliminating the hassle and giving time to actually code our your receipt data to your customers.
