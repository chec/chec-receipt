# Chec e-receipt email template with MJML 


This is a basic tutorial of creating your own custom e-receipt for your customers who have just made a purchase on your Chec e-Commerce website. We will be using MJML, an email templating framework to help with design and formatting. Check out MJML docs at https://mjml.io/documentation/. The best thing about MJML is the responsive templating, all attributes are automatically responsive, eliminating the hassle (because who really loves coding emails amiright) and thus giving time to actually code out your receipt data to your customers.  

We have made up this boilerplate template for you to start with. This bareboned template lays out all the necessary details your customer would look for in an e-receipt/invoice. So go head, clone this template and make it your own!
